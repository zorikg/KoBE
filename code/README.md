# Code
Script for reproducing results from the paper. 
* Reads the annotated files and computes KoBE score for each system output (for each language pair).
* Reads the human Direct Assessment (DA) scores from the WMT19 data and computes KoBE pearson correlations with them.
* Reads the WMT19 submitted metrics scores and reproduces the pearson correlations from the WMT19 Quality Estimation track.
